About:
Developed a powerful visualization tool that leverages a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to analyze Twitch Streams and extract valuable insights from spikes in activity. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I harnessed the expressive power of Twitch chat emotes, which transcend language barriers and provide a larger sample set for analysis. To gather the necessary data, I created a Jupyter Notebook file capable of collecting chat, emote, and video data.

The webpage interface showcases a stacked histogram on the right side, presenting the frequency of emote usage sorted from most to least popular. Each bar in the histogram displays the name of the emote and the corresponding number of times it was used, allowing for quick understanding and comparison. To enhance clarity, a key is provided to distinguish between selected emotes and the initialization phase, effectively separating the emotes from the charts.

The Message and Chatter Count chart provides valuable information on the total number of messages sent and the count of unique chatters. By interacting with this chart, users can select specific segments, prompting a real-time screenshot of the stream at that particular moment.

For a deeper analysis, the Emote Density Over Time chart depicts the emote density trends for each selected emote. Moreover, the tool supports zooming functionality, enabling users to focus on specific portions of interest by simply dragging and dropping.

With these enhanced features and an intuitive user interface, my visualization tool offers an immersive and insightful experience, empowering Twitch stream analysts to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in stream activity.
